### Statement of completion

Be subjective, grading & feedback should not take more than 5 minutes per assignment.

The deployed assignment utilizes jQuery to show the user a random number, and give each crystal a value. When the user clicks on a crystal, it adds the value to a number for the user. If the user's number is below the random number, the game keeps going. If the user's number is exactly the random number, the user wins. If the user's number goes over the random number, the user loses.

**Is the above statement correct?**

1. **Yes**: Grade will be an A or a B

2. **No**: Grade will be a C

3. **No idea, can't test**: Grade will be a D or F

### Yes (A or B)

If the student's assignment was pristine, give them an A, and an encouraging sentence for feedback.

If the student's assignment had a few areas for improvement, give them a B, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback.

### No (C)

Give the student a C, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### No idea (D or F)

If the project isn't deployed, the student receives a D.

If the student turned in nothing, the student receives an F.

Either way, explain to the student why they received that grade, and invite them to visit office hours for help.
