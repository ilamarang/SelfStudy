## Week 19 - Intro to ReactJS

### Overview

This week, we will introduce students to React, a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We'll go over key features of the framework: JSX, components, states, props, lifecycle events and so on. By the end of this unit, students should understand how React lets web devs build quicker and less resource-hungry sites than mere HTML and jQuery.
